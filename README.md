# Demonstrations for the **[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws)** project

[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) is a [Yocto
Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) Bitbake Metadata Layer. It
accelerates building [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)
(AWS) software you can install to [Embedded
Linux](https://elinux.org/Main_Page). You can use this to build IoT
solutions on AWS.

In this repository, you will find
[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) demonstrations.  These
demonstrations are based on both Poky (the Yocto Project reference implementation)
and real hardware.  Many times, the hardware will be
representative of actual uses of hardware listed in the [AWS Device
Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com).

The number of demonstrations will increase over time and your
contributions are very welcome!

## Images
Generally you can build all images for all "Demos", but some combinations do not work or do not make sense!
- [aws-demo-image](meta-aws-demos/recipes-core/images/aws-demo-image/README.md)

## Quick Start

To try out this project in QEMU, run the following commands:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
. init-build-env
export DEMO=qemu
bitbake aws-demo-image
runqemu slirp nographic
```

Please also consider these build host [requirements](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host).

## Building

This repository uses submodules and a simple wrapper script to set the default
`TEMPLATECONF` that allows users to select the device they want to build. The
first step is to clone down the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

*NOTE:* When dealing with submodules, it is highly recommended to enable
diffing of submodule history with:
```bash
git config diff.submodule log
```

Next, initialize the build environment, and optionally specify the build directory:

```bash
. init-build-env [BUILDDIR]
```

Finally, the images can be built - details in linked readme for each DEMO:

```bash
bitbake aws-demo-image
```
To build for a different device, set the `DEMO` (see [here](#Demonstration-environments)) environment variable,
like so:

```bash
export DEMO=ec2-arm64
bitbake aws-demo-image
```

For a list of all possible devices, see `meta-aws-demos/conf/devices`.

The `init-build-env` script adds a helper function called `get_demos` which
will list all devices that can be configured. This can be used to build all devices with:

```bash
for d in $(get_demos); do DEMO=$d bitbake core-image-minimal; done
```

## Adding new platforms

New platforms can be added by adding a new directory under
`meta-aws-demos/conf/devices`. This directory should contain 2 files:

`layers.conf`: This is the file that will be required in `bblayers.conf` when
the product is selected

`config.conf`: This is the file that will be required in `local.conf` when the
product is selected

## Why choose build configurations this way?

`TEMPLATECONF` is a great mechanism for initially populating a build
configuration, but it has a few shortcomings that arise because it will only
write the files if they don't already exist. Because of this, it's not suitable
to _share_ device configuration because users won't automatically get the new
configuration for a build when they change revisions in the repository. The
solution to this problem is quite simple though: Instead of including the build
configuration directly in the template files, the template files instead
`require` a file that is checked into source control. By doing this, users will
automatically get the correct build configuration when changing revisions, but
can still override anything they want in their `local.conf`

## Updating submodules to latest version of specified branch is easy.
The following will update upstream submodule changes recursively:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --init --recursive
```
